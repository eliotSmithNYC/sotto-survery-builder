You are helping me implement a small Survey Builder in Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind.

Use the App Router (app/), no pages/.

Use TypeScript and React function components with hooks.

Use TailwindCSS for styling. No external UI libraries.

Keep code small, composable, and production-ready.

For state: a useReducer for questions and a simple useState for responses in app/page.tsx.

Do NOT introduce global state libraries (no Zustand/Redux).

Implement exactly what I ask for; don’t invent extra features or libraries.

Prefer clear, boring code over clever code.
